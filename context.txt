Project: Order.Ieeja grocery storefront (Cloudflare Pages + D1).
Stack: React (Vite) with Tailwind design system (green accents, light/dark theme), lucide-react icons, TypeScript hooks/components, Cloudflare Pages Functions backend, Cloudflare D1 database for orders.

Structure highlights:
- src/: React app with MainLayout providing theme/locale context and checkout draft persistence, routed pages (Home, Discover, Product detail, Cart, Checkout, Checkout success, Orders, Support), reusable components (SiteNav, ProductsSection, CartSection, Toast, MobileStickyAction), hooks (useProducts, useCart, useOrders), utilities (formatCurrency, checkout helpers).
- functions/: Cloudflare Pages Functions (_worker.js router, products.js inventory endpoint, order.js order submission/listing backed by D1).
- migrations/: Versioned D1 schema migrations (0001_create_orders.sql, 0002_add_order_details.sql) applied locally; remote application pending.
- wrangler.toml: name="order-ieeja", compatibility_date="2025-07-18", pages_build_output_dir="dist", D1 binding ORDERS_DB -> database_id 0eaea965-4467-4aee-89a9-28aed83e4c79.

Current backend flow:
- POST /order validates cart payload, requires phone/address/slot/payment, persists to D1 (orders table with customer, delivery, payment fields), returns orderId + summary.
- GET /order lists recent orders (limit query param), includes structured customer/delivery/payment data used by Orders page.

Frontend state:
- Mobile sticky CTAs use two-tier lime/amber info chips with dual-action pills and now hide automatically when the keyboard opens.
- Discover page features compact mobile product cards with icon-only add control that expands to a unified “− badge +” pill once items are added; desktop retains full text buttons with tighter layout.
- Cart page mirrors the updated quantity styling and routes into a multi-step checkout that persists draft data across navigation, provides inline validation/focus handling, and now redirects to a dedicated success screen after submission.
- Order success screen shows confirmation summary with actions to track the order or start a new one; Orders page continues to fetch live customer/delivery/payment details.

Local setup/reminders:
- Development: npm run dev (Vite) + npm run cf:dev (Wrangler dev). D1 migrations applied locally (0001,0002); hold remote migration/app binding until deploy.
- Dev servers (vite or wrangler pages) may cache index.html; restart or disable cache in DevTools if hashed bundles 404.
- npm run build currently fails in this environment due to missing optional dependency `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`; reinstall dependencies if a local build is needed.
- Pending work ideas: richer Orders UI with status management, externalized slot/payment config, PWA/service worker manifest when ready.

Note: Keep dist/ out of git; Pages binding ORDERS_DB must be added in Cloudflare dashboard before deploy. Context last updated Nov 27, 2025 after checkout persistence improvements, sticky CTA keyboard handling, and dedicated success route.
