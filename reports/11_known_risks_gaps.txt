Topic: Known Risks and Gaps

Every system has loose screws; these are the ones to watch here.

- Tests: No automated tests beyond Ladle stories/manual scripts. Missing unit/integration coverage for auth, order validation, address CRUD, and status transitions.
- Stock integrity: Enforced via app checks + batch writes; races under high concurrency could still slip despite CHECK>=0 on stock_quantity.
- Compatibility: `compatibility_date` set to 2025-07-18; verify runtime support or adjust before deploy.
- Bindings: AUTH_SECRET and LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_KV must be configured; missing values yield 501s or disable rate limiting.
- Catalog updates: Products seeded via migration; adding new SKUs requires D1 writes or new migrations. Admin UI can edit/toggle existing items but doesn’t ingest new ones automatically.
- Build caveat: `npm run build` may fail locally if optional `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu` is absent; reinstall deps or add the optional package if needed.
